        <p id="about1">I am 26 year old attack helicopter from Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan. I was 6 years old when it happened.
            I was just a boy with dreams of flying alongside a Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopter, but everything changed when the firenation attacked.
            After that day, I promised that i would fly my rocket straight into the chinese.
